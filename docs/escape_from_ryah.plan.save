DONE! Intro scene + player name input mockup.
DONE! Letter by letter style text display. Still clungy.Considering use fade in/out method via animation editor. 
DONE! Crew starving when out of food and take damage.

++ Have to really think about art style and how broad platform/hardware, how low-end I really wanted to target the devices.
* Solution A : going low-res make a game in 640*400px use pixel-art, pixelled from drawing style. with limited pallete, maybe a subset of DB32 << I could test out this idea real quick with pixel art mockup.
* Solution B : Aesthetic first : stick with 1280*800px with comic style presentation. << For now Stick with this one.  


What to do next
===============

- Make a dummy crew die of starvation
-- Make 'out of food' notification pop up only 1 time whenever food ran out.
- Loading hub/landmark scene when player's ship reach the destination
- Make the ship stop when out of fuel + force player to go scavenge.
- When out of fuel player will continueusly lost food while waiting turns. -And also have a chance of drawing sickness status card.
